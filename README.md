This is the boilerplate for the Exercise Tracker project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker

## Finished the final project for my fCC Back End Development Certificate!

Github pages only hosts static HTML pages, so the [App](https://adamcodes2843.github.io/exercisetracker/) isn't functional from the provided url. For this full stack project I used node.js, express, mongodb and mongoose.
